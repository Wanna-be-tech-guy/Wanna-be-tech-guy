Hi, welcome to my little slice of "tech pie". I’m @Wanna-be-tech-guy (Andrew for those that know we personally). I have been in the tech space since 2008, but the last 5 years of career has seen a huge shift in focus from the physical work into more software and development oriented work, with the aims and hopes of moving into a DevOps role. 

Since this Github was created, I have gained vastly more knowledge on:
- Linux operations, control and management (mostly focused on RHEL and Ubuntu, with CentOS tossed in there from time to time)
- Virtualization
- Docker operations
- Networking (Infiniband and Ethernet)
- Automation (Ansible, Kubernetes)
- SQL
- Scripting (mostly python, some bash, Java/HTML/CSS)


I recently created a new repo (dev_ops_training) that will serve as my personal portifolo of sorts, as I advance in my self taught Dev_Ops training. The goal of that, is once my personal project is complete, I should have holistic understanding of:
- CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins)
- Kubernetes to orchestrate and manage Docker containers
- deployment automation scripting (writing a python script to "auto-deploy" VMs to my host(s))
- API's (also writting a script to scrub MAC address's for the newly created VMs, so I can assign static resverations in PFSense and created DNS records for the entire build and test enviroment)
- Ansible, Chef and Puppet to manage the Linux VMs
- Front and Backend Web development (The goal of the project, is to create an UI to interact and monitor all the VMs in the build enviroment, where I can easily deploy new VMs, create and modify DNS records, static reservations) and deploy small apps at the push of a button.

If you wish to collaborate on any of the this new project, reach out to me, since I am a "junior" (at best) Dev/Admin, I will welcome all the help I can get!

Cheers,
